      <p>
        As part of some team building exercise imposed on my fifth (or fourth…who can remember) 
        grade class, I along with everyone in the class was paired with another kid and were instructed 
        to play a game with the following rules: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Both players face each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          One holds their hands in front of them face down a few inches above the other’s whose hands are facing up.
        </li>
        <li>
          The one on the bottom tries to slap the tops of the hands of the other.
        </li>
        <li>
          When hands have been slapped, the players switch positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each successful slap, the slapper receives one Cheez-It.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I summoned all stealth and reflex to me and did okay at slapping and avoiding being slapped. My partner and 
        I played hard and our cheez-its slowly accumulated. Not long into the gameplay, I along with several others 
        noticed with indignation that some pairs were breaking the rules. Neither partner was trying to avoid being 
        slapped. They were just slapping each other's hands in rapid succession and their cheez-its piled up. I was 
        only more upset when the teacher did not discipline them but instead congratulated them on a game well played!

        Illustrated here are two interesting points:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Competition does not exist in a game; it is the way the players relate to each other during gameplay. 
          The perceived rules of the game shape that relationship and the players bring their own agency too.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games played cooperatively rather than competitively can create greater net value for the players.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        My thoughts don’t end here but this post does. Enjoy my versions of <nuxt-link to="/games/snake">Snake</nuxt-link>
        and <nuxt-link to="/games/pong">Pong</nuxt-link> I’ve put together and check back later for elaboration.
